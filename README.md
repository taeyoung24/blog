# Hello!

Let me introduce myself briefly for the visitors who might check out this page (like for a department project, for example).

1. My name is Taeyoung Jung (정태영)
2. I’m Korean and currently studying at Hanyang University ERICA (admitted in 2021) with a major in Computer Science (though I have a feeling only people from the Computer Science department will visit this).
3. I have a dog that I’m taking care of 🐶
4. I’m a fan of League of Legends esports, especially T1 and DK in the LCK 🎮
5. I also love K-pop, with groups like NMIXX and IVE being some of my favorites 🎶
6. Here are some programs I’ve developed 🖥️:
   - Created a GUI game using MS PowerPoint (even made a pretty decent online game).
   - Founded a club in high school and planned and provided games for our festival.
   - Developed and released a Discord app.
7. I have a keen interest in graphic design 🖌️

Thanks! Bye for now!
